        <h1>Lavacake</h1>
        <p>An SMP + canvas hosted on Eaglercraft 1.5.2.</p>
        <b>By canvas we mean a public creative world. Note that this will (obviously) not be hosted at the same time as the main survival world, but we'll find time for it.</b>

        <h2>SMP Rules</h2>
        <nav>
        <p>1. Don't purposely kill people (this one is obvious). 1 warning</p>
        <p>2. Stealing = 1 warning, must return items or kicked for the day</p>
        <p>3. Using buckets to flood rooms / other spaces with lava or water: 2 warnings, kicked for the day</p>
        <p>4. Destruction of other people's space with TNT: Instantly banned for a week (3 strikes).</p>
        <p>5. Be nice. Don't throw a tantrum just because you don't like someone else's opinion.</p>
        <p>6. Ask before expanding your space, as this can cause problems with plans or already existing spaces.</p>
        <p>7. Don't build any space outside of the main base. The base is intended to be for everyone, and building some random shitty dirt house where it might be really inconvenient for others is just a waste of space. Ask me for a room instead.</p>
        <b>2 strikes will result in a kick for the day. 3 strikes = banned for a week. 4 strikes = Permabanned.</b>
        </nav>

        <h2>Canvas Rules</h2>
        <p>1. Don't be an idiot. Doing things like making sw4st1kas or spamming dicks made of dirt = permanently banned.</p>
        <p>2. Griefing (setting other creations on fire, using TNT on them, flooding) = instant permaban.</p>
        <p>3. Collaborating is allowed, but don't randomly pitch in during someone's build. They're probably not going to like how you change it up and will just get you seen as a pest. Ask first to help them, and if they'd like to focus on it themselves then mind your own business. Insisting will get you a warning.</p>
