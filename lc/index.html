        <h1>Lavacake</h1>
        <p>An SMP + canvas hosted on Eaglercraft.</p>

        <h2>SMP Rules</h2>
        <nav>
        <p>1. Don't purposely kill people (this one is obvious). 1 strike.</p>
        <p>2. Stealing = 1 strike, must return items or kicked for the day</p>
        <p>3. Using buckets to flood rooms / other spaces with lava or water: 2 strikes, kicked for the day</p>
        <p>4. Destruction of other people's space with TNT: Instantly banned for a week (3 strikes).</p>
        <p>5. Be nice. Don't throw a tantrum just because you don't like someone else's opinion. If we keep having to tell you to cool down you'll be kicked (1 strike).</p>
        <p>6. Don't beg people for stuff. Get it yourself, don't be lazy. We're not going to baby you around.</p>
        <p>7. "Can I get Creative I wanna help build" Yeah sure you would never slide TNT and 2 stacks of diamonds into your inventory. Permabanned unless we actually know and trust you.</p>
        <b>2 strikes will result in a kick for the day. 3 strikes = banned for a week. 4 strikes = Permabanned.</b>
        </nav>

        <h2>Canvas Rules</h2>
        <p>1. Don't be an idiot. Doing things like making sw4st1kas or spamming dicks made of dirt = permanently banned.</p>
        <p>2. Griefing (setting other creations on fire, using TNT on them, flooding) = instant permaban.</p>
        <p>3. Collaborating is allowed, but don't randomly pitch in during someone's build. They're probably not going to like how you change it up and will just get you seen as a pest. Ask first to help them, and if they'd like to focus on it themselves then mind your own business. Insisting will get you a strike.</p>
